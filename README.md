# Understanding Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF): A Beginner's Guide for Engineers

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that explore the fundamental concepts behind Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a groundbreaking approach to 3D scene representation. If you're an engineering student or someone interested in the intersection of 3D graphics, computer vision, and machine learning, this is a great place to start your NeRF journey.

## Notebooks

1. **Introduction to NeRF:**  
   - Motivation for NeRF and its impact on engineering applications.
   - Overview of the topics covered in this repository.

2. **Representing the 3D World:**
   - Explores different ways to represent 3D objects (meshes, point clouds, volumetric representations).
   - Discusses the advantages and limitations of each approach.
   - Explains why volumetric representation is well-suited for NeRF.

3. **Capturing Light: The Pinhole Camera Model:**
   - Provides a clear explanation of how cameras capture 3D scenes.
   - Introduces the pinhole camera model and its equations.
   - Discusses the importance of camera poses and intrinsic parameters for NeRF.

4. **Generating Images: Rendering:**
   - Explains the process of creating 2D images from 3D scenes.
   - Covers the two main rendering methods: ray tracing and rasterization.
   - Introduces the concept of differentiable rendering, which is essential for NeRF optimization.
   - Includes a basic example of rendering with the Taichi library.

5. **Neural Networks: Our Universal Tool:**
   - Introduces the fundamentals of neural networks and their applications.
   - Explains why neural networks are powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and rendering.
   - Provides a conceptual JAX example of a simple neural network.

6. **View Synthesis: The NeRF Challenge:**
   - Defines the problem of view synthesis: generating new views of a scene from a limited set of images.
   - Discusses traditional approaches and their limitations.
   - Explains how NeRF overcomes these challenges with its implicit volumetric representation and neural network architecture.
   - Includes a simple visualization of ray sampling and frustums using Nerfstudio.

7. **NeRF Input: Images and Camera Poses**
   - Details the essential inputs for NeRF (images and camera poses).
   - Outlines methods and tools for obtaining accurate camera poses.

8. **NeRF Pipeline:**
   - Provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the NeRF pipeline.
   - Covers ray generation, sampling, model construction, volumetric rendering, and loss functions.

9. **Color and Density Prediction:**
    - Explains how NeRF uses an MLP to predict color and density at each point in the scene.

10. **Volumetric Rendering and Alpha Compositing:**
    - Details how the predicted colors and densities are combined to render a 2D image.
